                How can I do private transactions?
              </StyledFAQSubTitle>
              <StyledFAQContent>
                After depositing the tokens, a secret key will be generated which will serve as a proof for token
                withdrawal.
                This means that smart contracts will store the deposit data that is tied to the key, not the wallet.
                The deposited tokens can be withdrawn by any other account. When there are many subsequent transactions
                in the pool, it is impossible to link deposits and withdrawals to each other, thus preserving privacy on
                the public blockchain.

                What is a synthetic asset and how can I use it?
              </StyledFAQSubTitle>
              <StyledFAQContent>
                Cryptocurrency-based synthetic assets aim to give users exposure to a variety of different assets
                without needing to hold the underlying asset. This could be anything from fiat currencies, such as the
                United States dollar or the Japanese yen, to commodities like gold and silver, as well as index funds or
                other digital assets.
                On the Sahara platform, you can safely convert one private synthetic asset into another synthetic asset.
